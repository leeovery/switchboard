// transport cloned from it after, dial loopback, and unix sockets in the
// temporary directory, alone.

// After them, it fails the run, even when every test passed, if a stub ran,
// a dial was blocked, switchboard's real config or themes directory changed,
// its state directory appeared, or a token file in it appeared or changed,

// CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR put it, its bin directory did, in the real home or
// wherever XDG_DATA_HOME put it, or a claude link did in a directory on the
